The files I used in this assignment and what they're usage was:

List.c: This is all of my list functions and structs that I used in my Matrix.c 


List.h: This is all my function definitions for all my functions in List.c


Matrix.c: This is all my Matrix functions and structs including helper functions I used to create the matrix calculator and called these functions in Sparse.c


Matrix.h: This is all my function definitions and for all my functions in Matrix.h


ListTest.c: This is all my list tests that I used to call all of my new list functions and make sure they work properly.


MatrixTest.c: This is all my matrix tests that I used to call all of my matrix functions and make sure they work properly.


Sparse.c: This is where I parsed my input file, called all my functions necessary in Matrix.c, and wrote to the output file.


Makefile: This is the Makefile I used to compile my code and make the binary executables.


README.md: This is where I wrote a summary on each of the files I submitted
