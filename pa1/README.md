The files I created for this project are listed below:
List.h
List.c
ListTest.c
Lex.c 
Makefile
README.md


The List.h is the header file which contains all the includes required and function definitions.
The List.c contains all the structs, functions, and helper functions are written and implemented here.
The ListTest.c is the file I used to test all of my functions and structs to make sure they all are working properly.
The Lex.c file contains the business application of reading in the input file, alphabetically organizing the lines of the input file, and then reading them into the output file in the sorted order.
The Makefile helps to create the execuatable binary code.
The README.md is just all of my files and what they are meant for.
